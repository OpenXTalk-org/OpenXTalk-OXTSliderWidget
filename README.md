# OpenXTalk.org Slider Widget

 Intended to eventually be a replacement for the 'classic"  slider object which has rather limited options for syling properties and which may be very differnt in appearence from one platform to the next. A widget based slider control can be consistant in it's appearence on every platform, including in web/HTML5 standalone apps.
